## Workflow Routing (SYSTEM PROMPT)

**CRITICAL: Route to the correct workflow based on user intent.**

**When user needs to set up or configure Meta Ads API access:**
Examples: "set up meta ads", "connect meta ads", "configure facebook ads", "my token expired", "meta ads setup", credential errors from --check
-> **READ:** ~/.claude/skills/MetaAds/workflows/Setup.md
-> **EXECUTE:** Walk user through complete setup (Business Manager, App, token, .env)

**When user wants to publish, create, or launch a campaign:**
Examples: "publish ads", "create campaign", "launch campaign", "upload ad images", "publish meta ads", "push this campaign to Meta", "create ad set"
-> **READ:** ~/.claude/skills/MetaAds/workflows/PublishCampaign.md
-> **EXECUTE:** Campaign publishing workflow
-> If credentials fail, route to Setup.md first

**When user wants to check performance, metrics, or analyze results:**
Examples: "check meta ad performance", "ROAS", "which ad is winning", "ad spend", "campaign metrics", "how are my ads doing", "audience breakdown", "creative performance"
-> **READ:** ~/.claude/skills/MetaAds/workflows/AnalyzePerformance.md
-> **EXECUTE:** Performance analysis workflow
-> If credentials fail, route to Setup.md first

**When user wants to manage campaigns (pause/resume/status):**
Examples: "pause campaign", "resume campaign", "campaign status", "list campaigns"
-> Use `uv run ~/.claude/skills/MetaAds/tools/Publish.py` directly with --pause, --resume, --status, or --list

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `tools/Publish.py` | Campaign creation, image upload, pause/resume |
| `tools/Analytics.py` | Performance metrics, breakdowns, sync, export |

Both scripts use PEP 723 inline dependencies — just run with `uv run` directly from the skill directory. No install or copy step needed.

### Usage

Run scripts directly from the skill directory. They load `.env` from the current working directory (`Path.cwd()`), so run them from your project root:

```bash
# From your project root (where .env lives):
uv run ~/.claude/skills/MetaAds/tools/Publish.py --check
uv run ~/.claude/skills/MetaAds/tools/Analytics.py --summary
```

**Prerequisites:** `uv` must be installed. If not: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`

**Environment Variables (`.env`):**
| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `META_ADS_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Yes | System User or long-lived User token |
| `META_ADS_ACCOUNT_ID` | Yes | Ad account ID with `act_` prefix |
| `FACEBOOK_APP_ID` | For refresh | App ID for token exchange |
| `FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET` | For refresh | App Secret for token exchange |

## Campaign Objective Reference

Use these objectives in campaign configs:

| Objective | When to Use | Optimization Goal |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| `OUTCOME_SALES` | DTC purchases, Shopify conversions | `OFFSITE_CONVERSIONS` |
| `OUTCOME_LEADS` | Lead gen, email signups, quiz funnels | `LEAD_GENERATION` |
| `OUTCOME_TRAFFIC` | Landing page visits, blog traffic | `LINK_CLICKS` |
| `OUTCOME_AWARENESS` | Brand awareness, video views | `REACH` or `IMPRESSIONS` |
| `OUTCOME_ENGAGEMENT` | Post engagement, page likes | `POST_ENGAGEMENT` |

---

## Campaign Config Template

Generic template for any DTC brand:

```json
{
  "campaign": {
    "name": "campaign-name-month-year",
    "objective": "OUTCOME_SALES"
  },
  "adsets": [
    {
      "name": "Broad-25-54-US",
      "daily_budget": 5000,
      "targeting": {
        "age_min": 25,
        "age_max": 54,
        "genders": [0],
        "geo_locations": {"countries": ["US"]},
        "publisher_platforms": ["facebook", "instagram"],
        "facebook_positions": ["feed", "video_feeds", "story", "reels"],
        "instagram_positions": ["stream", "story", "reels", "explore"]
      },
      "optimization_goal": "OFFSITE_CONVERSIONS",
      "bid_strategy": "LOWEST_COST_WITHOUT_CAP"
    }
  ],
  "creative": {
    "images_directory": "./path/to/ad-images/",
    "primary_texts": [
      "Primary text variant 1 — lead with the hook or pain point",
      "Primary text variant 2 — lead with the benefit or social proof",
      "Primary text variant 3 — lead with a comparison or price anchor"
    ],
    "headlines": [
      "Short Punchy Headline",
      "Benefit-Driven Headline",
      "Price/Value Headline"
    ],
    "descriptions": [
      "Supporting description with key differentiator"
    ],
    "link_url": "https://yoursite.com/landing-page",
    "url_parameters": "utm_source=meta&utm_medium=paid-social&utm_campaign=campaign-name&utm_content={{ad.name}}",
    "call_to_action_type": "SHOP_NOW"
  }
}
```

**Config notes:**
- `daily_budget` is in **cents** (5000 = $50.00/day)
- `genders`: 0 = all, 1 = male, 2 = female
- `{{ad.name}}` is a Meta dynamic parameter — auto-fills with the ad name
- `call_to_action_type` options: `SHOP_NOW`, `LEARN_MORE`, `SIGN_UP`, `GET_OFFER`, `ORDER_NOW`, `SUBSCRIBE`, `BOOK_NOW`

## DTC Benchmark Reference

| Metric | Good | OK | Needs Work | What It Means |
|--------|------|----|------------|---------------|
| CTR | >1.5% | 1-1.5% | <1% | % of impressions that click. Low = creative isn't resonating |
| CPM | <$15 | $15-25 | >$25 | Cost per 1000 impressions. High = competitive auction or narrow audience |
| CPC | <$1 | $1-2 | >$2 | Cost per click. High = low CTR driving up costs |
| CPA | <$30 | $30-50 | >$50 | Cost per purchase. The ultimate efficiency metric |
| ROAS | >3x | 2-3x | <2x | Revenue per $1 spent. Below 2x usually means losing money after COGS |
| Frequency | 1-3 | 3-5 | >5 | Avg times each person saw the ad. High = ad fatigue |
| Hook Rate | >25% | 15-25% | <15% | % who watch first 3 sec of video. Low = weak opening |
| Hold Rate | >10% | 5-10% | <5% | % who watch 15+ sec. Low = content doesn't sustain interest |

## Optimization Playbook

**Scaling winners:**
- Increase budget by 20-30% every 2-3 days (not all at once — resets learning)
- Duplicate winning ad sets with new audiences
- Create lookalike audiences from purchasers

**Fixing underperformers:**
- CTR < 1%: Test new hooks/images — the creative isn't stopping thumbs
- CTR > 2% but no purchases: Landing page problem, not ad problem
- CPA too high: Narrow targeting or test lower-funnel audiences
- Frequency > 4: Rotate in fresh creative
- No spend after 48 hours: Switch optimization to Link Clicks temporarily, then back to Conversions

**Meta learning phase:**
- Each ad set needs ~50 conversions in 7 days to exit learning
- Don't edit during learning (resets the clock)
- If budget is too low for 50 conversions/week, optimize for a higher-funnel event (ATC instead of Purchase)
